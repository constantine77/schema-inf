Here are the steps to install Java 11 on macOS:

Open a web browser and go to the Oracle Java SE Development Kit 11 Downloads page at https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html.

Scroll down to the macOS section and click on the Download button for the macOS Installer.

Once the download is complete, double-click the downloaded file to start the installation.

Follow the instructions in the installation wizard to complete the installation process.

After installation, open Terminal and type the following command to check if Java 11 is installed:

Copy code
java -version
If Java 11 is not the default version, you can use the following command to set it as the default:
bash
Copy code
sudo ln -sf /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java /usr/bin/java
Finally, verify that Java 11 is now the default by running the following command again:
Copy code
java -version
That's it! You have successfully installed Java 11 on macOS.

If you are getting an error when trying to set Java 11 as the default version using the command I provided, it may be because the location of the JDK is different on your system.

You can try the following steps to set Java 11 as the default version:

First, check the location of your Java 11 installation by running the following command in Terminal:
bash
Copy code
ls /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/
This will list the directories of all the installed JDKs on your system.

Locate the directory for Java 11. It should be something like jdk-11.jdk.

Use the following command to set Java 11 as the default version:

bash
Copy code
sudo ln -sfn /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java /usr/local/bin/java
Make sure to replace jdk-11.jdk with the name of the directory for your Java 11 installation if it's different.

Verify that Java 11 is now the default version by running the following command:
Copy code
java -version
This should now show that Java 11 is the default version on your system.

I hope this helps!


Sure, here are the steps to activate Java version 11 only using terminal commands on a Mac:

Open the Terminal application on your Mac. You can find it in the Applications/Utilities folder or by searching for it using Spotlight.

Check if Java 11 is already installed on your system by running the following command in the terminal:

Copy code
java -version
If Java 11 is not installed, you can download and install it from the official Java website.

Once you have Java 11 installed, you can use the following command in the terminal to set it as the default Java version:

bash
Copy code
sudo ln -sf /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java /usr/bin/java
This will create a symbolic link from the system's /usr/bin/java command to the Java 11 installation.

You can verify that Java 11 is the default version by running the following command in the terminal:

Copy code
java -version
The output should now display the version of Java 11.

To make this change permanent, you can add the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc for the Bash shell or ~/.zshrc for the Zsh shell):

bash
Copy code
export PATH="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.jdk/Contents/Home/bin:$PATH"
This will add the Java 11 installation directory to the system's PATH environment variable, ensuring that the Java 11 version is used by default.

Restart your terminal or run the following command to reload your shell configuration:

bash
Copy code
source ~/.bashrc
That's it! You have activated Java version 11 only using terminal commands on your Mac.
