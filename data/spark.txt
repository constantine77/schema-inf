Implementation of Spark listeners and lineage spark-collector.

Spark listeners are a way to monitor and interact with Spark's execution. They provide a way to trigger certain actions when specific events occur in Spark. Here are the general steps to implement a Spark listener:

a. Create a Custom Listener: This will require creating a class in Java or Scala that extends org.apache.spark.scheduler.SparkListener. This class can then override the necessary methods to capture the desired events. For example, you might override onJobStart, onTaskEnd, etc.

b. Register the Listener: Once the custom listener is defined, it needs to be registered with the SparkContext. This can be done using the addSparkListener method of the SparkContext.

c. Log/Act on Events: Once the listener is registered, it will start receiving events. Depending on the methods that were overridden, you can capture a variety of information and perform necessary actions.

Lineage Spark-Collector
To maintain data lineage information (i.e., the journey of data from its source to destination), you can leverage the spark lineage plugin like Spline or implement your custom collector:

a. Define Your Data Lineage Schema: Depending on the granularity of data lineage you want to capture, you need to define your data lineage schema. This could be at the job level, RDD level, or even at the dataframe level.

b. Implement Data Lineage Capture: This can be done using the Spark listener interface as well. Create a custom listener that captures the necessary lineage information based on the operations (transformations and actions) performed on your data.

c. Persist Data Lineage: After capturing the lineage information, you need to persist this information for future reference. This could be stored in a database, a file, or sent to a downstream system for further processing.

It's worth noting that capturing data lineage at a very granular level can add overhead to your Spark jobs, so it's important to find a balance between the level of detail and performance.

Given that your SDK also includes functionality like schema validation, data quality checks, tokenization, and write access requests, you'll also need to consider how these components interact with and feed into your Spark listeners and data lineage capture. For instance, schema validation results and data quality checks might be part of the metadata you want to capture in your data lineage.

###Maven vs SBT:

Both Maven and SBT are popular build tools in the Java/Scala ecosystem, and each comes with its own set of strengths and weaknesses. The decision between them often comes down to your specific needs and preferences. Here are some considerations that could guide your decision:

Project Structure and Complexity:

Maven uses an XML-based pom.xml file for configuration and follows a convention-over-configuration philosophy. If you have a large multi-module project with many dependencies, Maven may be a good choice due to its standardized structure.
SBT, on the other hand, is Scala-based and tends to be more flexible and extensible, which may be advantageous for complex or unconventional project structures.
Scala Support:

If your project is predominantly Scala, SBT might be the better choice. It was specifically designed for Scala and has first-class support for Scala features. This includes incremental compilation and REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) support for quick testing and debugging.
Community and Ecosystem:

Maven has been around longer and has a larger community and ecosystem. This means more resources, plugins, and potentially better integration with other tools and IDEs.
SBT, though younger, has a strong community within the Scala ecosystem.
Cross-building:

SBT has built-in support for cross-building (compiling your project against multiple versions of Scala). If you need to support multiple Scala versions, SBT makes this fairly straightforward.
Maven can also support cross-building, but it might require more configuration and setup.
Learning Curve:

Maven is generally considered easier to learn, with a more straightforward approach and extensive documentation.
SBT can be more complex to learn, particularly if you're new to Scala.
Performance:

SBT generally offers faster compilation times for Scala code due to its incremental compilation feature.
Maven, while not as fast for Scala compilation, might be faster for Java projects or mixed Java/Scala projects.
Dependency Management:

Both SBT and Maven have robust dependency management, but their approaches differ. Maven's approach is more static and standardized, while SBT offers more flexibility and dynamic dependency resolution.
It's important to weigh these factors against your specific needs and constraints, such as team familiarity with the tools, the nature of your project, and your overall development process.

### SBT

Considering that your project needs to handle multiple versions of EMR, Spark, and Scala, SBT might be the better choice due to its superior support for cross-building and Scala.

SBT provides out-of-the-box support for cross-building, which is the process of building and testing your project against multiple versions of Scala or a library. This is crucial when you want to ensure compatibility with multiple versions of a dependency.

Here is a general approach on how to set up cross-building with SBT:

Specify Scala Versions:
In your build.sbt file, you can specify the versions of Scala your project should be built against:

crossScalaVersions := Seq("2.11.12", "2.12.10", "2.13.1")

Cross-Compatible Code:
You might need to write cross-compatible code or source files, especially if there are breaking changes between Scala versions. SBT allows you to create version-specific source directories (like src/main/scala-2.12, src/main/scala-2.13) where you can put version-specific code.

Cross-Building Dependencies:
For cross-building with different versions of libraries like Spark, you can use the %% operator when specifying the library dependency, which appends the Scala version to the artifact name:

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-core" % sparkVersion,
  "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-sql" % sparkVersion
)

Here, sparkVersion would be set depending on the Scala version. You can handle this in your build.sbt or a separate .scala build file if your build logic is complex.

Building and Testing:
To build and test against all specified Scala versions, use + command in SBT, like + test to run tests against all Scala versions, or + publish to publish artifacts for all versions.

Continuous Integration:
Include all Scala versions in your CI server configuration to ensure that your project is tested against all versions on every commit.

Remember, cross-building can add complexity to your project, so it's important to have a clear understanding of your version compatibility requirements and to thoroughly test your project under all the configurations you intend to support.

How about Maven, how to implement it

ChatGPT
Maven does not natively support cross-compilation as elegantly as SBT does. However, you can manage it with some extra configuration and tooling. Here is an approach to how you can handle this using 


### Maven:

Profiles:
You can define different profiles for the different versions of Scala you want to cross-compile against. In your pom.xml, you can define profiles like this:

xml
Copy code
<profiles>
  <profile>
    <id>scala-2.11</id>
    <properties>
      <scala.version>2.11.12</scala.version>
      <spark.version>2.4.7</spark.version>
    </properties>
  </profile>
  <profile>
    <id>scala-2.12</id>
    <properties>
      <scala.version>2.12.10</scala.version>
      <spark.version>2.4.7</spark.version>
    </properties>
  </profile>
</profiles>
Here, scala.version and spark.version would be used in your dependencies section.

Dependencies:
In the dependencies section of your pom.xml, you can specify the versions of Scala and Spark like this:

xml
Copy code
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.scala-lang</groupId>
    <artifactId>scala-library</artifactId>
    <version>${scala.version}</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.spark</groupId>
    <artifactId>spark-core_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>
    <version>${spark.version}</version>
  </dependency>
  <!-- other dependencies -->
</dependencies>
Note that scala.binary.version should be a property representing the binary version of Scala (like "2.11" or "2.12").

Cross-Compatible Code:
If you need to write code that is specific to a version of Scala, you can create version-specific source directories and configure the Maven Scala plugin to compile them only for the respective profile.

Building and Testing:
You can build and test your project for a specific profile using the -P option, like mvn clean package -P scala-2.11 or mvn test -P scala-2.11.

Continuous Integration:
On your CI server, you can set up jobs for each profile to ensure that your project is tested against all versions on every commit.

Remember, the Maven approach to cross-building is more verbose and less flexible than the SBT approach. It might be more suitable for simpler projects or teams that are already heavily invested in Maven. If your project is complex or you expect to support many versions of Scala and Spark, SBT might be a better choice.
