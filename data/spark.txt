Here are the steps to install Java 11 on macOS:

Open a web browser and go to the Oracle Java SE Development Kit 11 Downloads page at https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html.

Scroll down to the macOS section and click on the Download button for the macOS Installer.

Once the download is complete, double-click the downloaded file to start the installation.

Follow the instructions in the installation wizard to complete the installation process.

After installation, open Terminal and type the following command to check if Java 11 is installed:

Copy code
java -version
If Java 11 is not the default version, you can use the following command to set it as the default:
bash
Copy code
sudo ln -sf /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java /usr/bin/java
Finally, verify that Java 11 is now the default by running the following command again:
Copy code
java -version
That's it! You have successfully installed Java 11 on macOS.

If you are getting an error when trying to set Java 11 as the default version using the command I provided, it may be because the location of the JDK is different on your system.

You can try the following steps to set Java 11 as the default version:

First, check the location of your Java 11 installation by running the following command in Terminal:
bash
Copy code
ls /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/
This will list the directories of all the installed JDKs on your system.

Locate the directory for Java 11. It should be something like jdk-11.jdk.

Use the following command to set Java 11 as the default version:

bash
Copy code
sudo ln -sfn /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java /usr/local/bin/java
Make sure to replace jdk-11.jdk with the name of the directory for your Java 11 installation if it's different.

Verify that Java 11 is now the default version by running the following command:
Copy code
java -version
This should now show that Java 11 is the default version on your system.

I hope this helps!
